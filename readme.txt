Simple Revisions Delete add a discreet link within a post submit box to let you purge (delete) its revisions via AJAX.


== Description ==

= What does it do? =
It helps you keep a clean database by removing unnecessary posts revisions. Unlike other similar plugins, it lets you delete only specific posts revisions, not all your site revisions at once.
The plugin is perfectly integrated in the WordPress post edition page, and uses native core functions to safely delete revisions.
It is very lightweight, very simple to use, and just does the job!

= How does it work? =

The plugin adds a discreet link in the post submit box, next to the default revisions counter (see screenshots section).
When you click on it, it will purge the appropriate post revisions via AJAX.


NOTE: There is no admin page for this plugin - none is needed.

= Languages =
The plugin only bears a few sentences, but you can easily translate them through .MO & .PO files. Currently available languages are:
* English
* French
